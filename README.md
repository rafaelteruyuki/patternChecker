# patternChecker
 JavaScript test 

Given a string text and a pattern.  Evaluate if a given text string matches a specified pattern, utilizing special characters for pattern matching.

The pattern matching should adhere to the following rules:
  - The symbol ``.`` represents any individual character.
  - The symbol ``*`` indicates zero or more occurrences of the character that appears just before it.

Return **true** if the pattern corresponds exactly to the entire text string, if not return **false**.

Note:
  - Your implementation should not be dependent on regular expression or similar convenient libraries.
  - Your implementation should be able to handle all hidden test cases correctly.

**Example 1:**
  - Input: text = 'aa', pattern = 'a'
  - Output: false 
  - Explanation: The single ``'a'`` does not match the full text ``'aa'``.

**Example 2:**
Input: text = 'aa', pattern = 'a*'
Output: true 
Explanation: The pattern ``'a*'`` can represent ``'aa'`` as ``'*'`` allows for repeating ``'a'``.

**Example 3:**
Input: text = 'ab', pattern = '.*'
Output: true
Explanation: The pattern ``'.*'`` can match any sequence of characters.

Constraints
  - ``1 <= text.length <= 20``
  - ``1 <= pattern.length <= 20``
  - ``text`` contains only lowercase English letters.
  - ``pattern`` contains only lowercase English letters, ``'.'``, and ``'*'``.
  - It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character ``'*'``, there will be a previous valid character to match.
